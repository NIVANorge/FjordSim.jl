    NORA3Config(; data_root, output_directory, years, kw...)

Atmosphere configuration for the MET Norway NORA3 reanalysis, served per forecast lead hour over
OPeNDAP from `thredds.met.no`.

Only `opendap_url` is defaulted among the source's own settings, being NORA3's public endpoint.
`data_root`, `output_directory` and `years` have no defaults, so a setup that forgets one gets an
`UndefKeywordError` rather than a silent fallback.

The download normalizes NORA3's forecast structure away: it selects the forecast lead supplying
each hour, de-accumulates the accumulated fluxes *within* a run, rotates the winds to
eastward/northward, and writes one gap-free hourly file per month already carrying the eight
prepared variable names. `prepare_atmosphere` is then a pure regrid.

Two deliberate differences from the reference Python pipeline this ports, and therefore from a
file it produced: `swrad` here is the downwelling shortwave flux rather than the net one, and the
hourly axis is built from the forecast leads themselves rather than padded at the start by
repeating the first step.

# Fields
- `data_root`: Directory the other paths resolve against.
- `output_directory`: Where the downloaded monthly files go, via `atmosphere_directory`.
- `output_file`: The prepared file, via `atmosphere_path`.

- `opendap_url`: Base OPeNDAP URL of the NORA3 file archive.
- `resolution`: Prepared grid spacing in degrees.
- `padding`: Degrees of margin added around the ocean domain.
- `years`: Calendar years to prepare. Hours 00:00 to 03:00 of 1 January come from the 18Z run of
  31 December of the preceding year, which is fetched automatically.

A relative `output_file`, `plot_file` or `output_directory` resolves against `data_root`; an
absolute one relocates just that file.

therefore report about -2000 W/m² at each 6-hour boundary.

Each increment is labelled at the *end* of its interval, which is what puts the fluxes on the same
