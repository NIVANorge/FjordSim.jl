    fill_boundary_gaps!(data)

Replace every non-finite value in `data` with the nearest finite one along the boundary, per level
and per time step; zero where a whole line is dry. Mutates and returns `data`.

The prepared file marks a dry boundary cell `NaN`, as every FjordSim prepared file does. Unlike the
interior forcing, though, a boundary series is read as an *exterior value* by schemes that do
arithmetic on it directly, and only some of the nodes they write are ones the grid calls closed.

The tangential velocity is the case that forces this. On a south edge it is `u`, whose faces at
`i = 1` and `i = Nx + 1` are peripheral — the halo column outside them is inactive — so `water_mask`
marks them dry and the prepared file has a hole there. But `immersed_peripheral_node`, which is what
`NormalRadiation` zeroes on, is about the *immersed* boundary and is false at a wet domain-edge face,
so the hole would be read as a real exterior velocity and nudged into the halo at both bottom corners
of the domain. A sentinel value would be worse than a neighbouring one, and a neighbouring one is
what every other gap-filling step in this package already chooses (`SourceFill`, `daily_time_steps`).
