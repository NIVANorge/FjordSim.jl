# The `oslofjorden()` setup with the simplest OceanBioME.jl biogeochemistry bolted on: a
# four-compartment nitrogen NPZD model (nutrient, phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus) in
# mmol N m⁻³.
#
# Nothing in `src/` changes. The point of this file is to show the three ways an out-of-tree config
# extends FjordSim, in increasing order of reach:
#
#   1. **Reuse.** `oslofjorden()` is called, and the pieces that need no change — the grid, the
#      bathymetry, the atmosphere — are passed straight through.
#   2. **A new config subtype with a new hook method.** `NPZDModel`, `NPZDRivers` and
#      `NPZDBoundaries` subtype an `Abstract*Config`, hold the built-in config they extend, and
#      delegate every hook but the one or two they mean to change. That is the documented way to add
#      a source (`docs/adding-a-source.md`) and it is all rivers and the model need.
#   3. **A new method on a *pipeline* generic.** `prepare_forcing` and `prepare_boundaries` are
#      generic functions dispatching on the config type, so `NPZDForcing` and `NPZDBoundaries` add a
#      method that runs the built-in pipeline and then *appends* the biogeochemical variables to the
#      file it wrote. Same copy-then-patch shape `add_rivers` already uses on the forcing file.
#
# (3) is what buys everything else for free. Once `forcing_npzd.nc` carries `N`/`N_lambda` and
# `boundaries_npzd.nc` carries `south_N`, three pieces of FjordSim that were written to be
# name-driven pick the new tracers up with no further code:
#
#   * `state_variables` intersects `model_tracers` with the file's variables, so `FromForcing()`
#     starts N, P, Z and D from the prepared field.
#   * `write_rivers` patches any series variable the file already carries, so river nitrate lands in
#     the same cells and on the same relaxation rates as river temperature and salinity.
#   * `open_tracer_boundary_conditions` radiates *every* model tracer towards its own prepared
#     series, so `OpenLateralBoundaryFromData` needs no change at all — it would in fact **error**
#     without `south_N`, which is why the boundary append is not optional.
#
# The prepared files are new names under the shared `data_root`, so the downloads are reused and
# `oslofjorden()`'s own `forcing.nc` and `boundaries.nc` are left untouched:
#
#   julia --project -m FjordSim prepare_bathymetry  --config oslofjorden          # shared, if not run
#   julia --project -m FjordSim download_forcing    --config oslofjorden          # shared

# `add_rivers` needs `NVE_API_KEY`, exactly as `oslofjorden()` does.

`base`'s model with OceanBioME's NPZD attached.

A config of its own rather than a `biogeochemistry` field on `base`, because `NPZD` needs the grid
and `CoupledHydrostaticSimulation` is built long before there is one — `build_simulation` reads the
grid out of the processed bathymetry. `free_surface` and `model_closure` already solve that by
taking a config and being called with the grid once it exists; `biogeochemistry` has no such hook,
so this type supplies one at the level above, by rebuilding `base` inside `coupled_simulation`.

`tracers` has to be spelled out in full. Oceananigans merges a biogeochemical model's required
tracers into the model's own only when *none* of them is named already
(`has_biogeochemical_tracers`), and NPZD requires `:T` — its growth rate carries a Q₁₀ — which every
FjordSim setup names. All-but-one present is an `ArgumentError`, so the list must be complete.
Naming it here is what `model_tracers` reports, and that is what decides the forcing terms, the open

element through `required_biogeochemical_tracers` — and `PhytoZoo`'s list is `(:P, :Z, :T)`, `:T`
being *temperature*, which it requires for its Q₁₀ and which is not a nitrogen pool at all. The
scaler would therefore rescale temperature along with the nutrients on any cell holding a negative
tracer, and set it to `NaN` wherever `N + P + Z + T + D` went negative. A `NaN` temperature is a
`NaN` buoyancy, hence a `NaN` velocity, hence a `NaN` `Δt` — which is exactly how this run used to
die, in `calculate_substeps`, before the first hour was out.

So the modifier is built here instead, over the four tracers that really do carry the nitrogen, and
`scale_negatives` stays at its `false` default. `NPZD_PROFILES` names them, so the set cannot drift
apart from the one the forcing and the boundary appends write.

    NPZDRivers(base; output_file, plot_file)

`base`'s rivers, carrying nitrate as well as temperature and salinity.

Every hook but `river_series` delegates, so the outlets are still the ones `NVERiversConfig`
discovers from NVE's ELVIS network, still placed at the same cells, still relaxed at the same
λ = Q̄/V. Only the values change, and only by one variable.

The alternative was `NVERiversConfig`'s `constants` field, which already writes one fixed value per
variable at every outlet. It is rejected here for what it cannot say: nitrogen in a Norwegian river
is a catchment property — Glomma drains the agricultural Østlandet at 638 µg TotN/L, Drammenselva
463 — and one number for all twenty-one outlets would throw that away.

`standalone` stays `false`: this patches a copy of the prepared forcing, so `FromForcing()` below
still has a full ocean state to start from.

*load* and an annual water volume, and their ratio is a flow-weighted mean concentration with no
seasonal information in it. A seasonal cycle here would be invention, and the discharge these
concentrations multiply is already the observed HydAPI series — so the river nitrogen *flux* varies
through the year even though its concentration does not.

Keyed by outlet *name*, which is the only identifier a `RiverLocation` carries — `vassdragsnr`, what
`oslofjorden()` keys its own overrides by, does not survive into one. A name is a weaker key: the
gauged rivers are named only because that setup's overrides state a `name`, and renaming one there
would drop it to `RIVER_TOTAL_NITROGEN_DEFAULT` with nothing to notice. Hence the log line, which
says which outlets were matched and which took the default.

"""
    NPZDForcing(base)

`base`'s interior forcing with the four NPZD tracers appended to whatever it prepares.

Only `prepare_forcing` is overloaded. `simulation_forcing` and `forcing_date_range` are the
supertype defaults, because the appended variables are in exactly the layout those readers already
expect — one `name`/`name_lambda` pair on `("Nx", "Ny", "Nz", "time")` — which is the point of
appending rather than writing a second file.

There is no hook inside `prepare_forcing` for a *synthesized* variable, and deliberately so: the
generic pipeline reads every variable it writes out of a downloaded source file, and validates it
against one. That is the right contract for a dataset adapter and the wrong one for a profile out of
a report, so this extends the pipeline at the level where it composes — a second method on
`prepare_forcing` itself — rather than pretending the values came from NorKyst.

"""
    NPZDBoundaries(base)

`base`'s open-boundary data with the four NPZD tracers appended to the file it prepares.

Not optional. `open_tracer_boundary_conditions` puts a radiating `Value` condition on *every* tracer
`model_tracers` names, and `boundary_series_value` raises rather than defaulting when the prepared
file has no series for one — naming an open edge is a statement that the boundary data supplies the
whole exterior state there. So `OpenLateralBoundaryFromData` below is `oslofjorden()`'s, unchanged,
and this is what makes it work.

`boundary_variable_names` is extended as well as `prepare_boundaries`: the map is what
`boundary_edge_series` reads the file back through, so a variable missing from it would be written
and then ignored. The four new entries are keyed by themselves rather than by a NorKyst variable —
nothing in the download corresponds to them, and nothing looks for them there, because
`prepare_boundaries` only ever considers the source names listed in `parameters`.
