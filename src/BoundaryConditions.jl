    quadratic_bottom_drag_boundary_conditions(coefficient)

Quadratic drag on `u` and `v` at the bottom, at the given dimensionless drag `coefficient`.

Needs neither the grid nor the forcing — all four of `u_quadratic_bottom_drag`,
`v_quadratic_bottom_drag`, `u_immersed_bottom_drag` and `v_immersed_bottom_drag` are discrete-form
functions taking the coefficient as their parameter — which is exactly why it is separable from the
surface half.

**Both halves are required, and the `bottom` one alone does nothing on a fjord.** A `bottom` condition
acts at the *underlying* grid's floor, and `u_quadratic_bottom_drag` hardcodes that level's index,
reading `Φ.u[i, j, 1]`. On an `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` whose deepest column stops short of `k = 1` —
which every one of these setups is, `z_faces` reaching well below the deepest sounding so no column is
clipped — that cell is immersed in the entire domain and the flux is discarded. The seabed the fjord
actually has is the *immersed* boundary, and it takes an `ImmersedBoundaryCondition` to put a stress
on it; without one, Oceananigans' default there is free slip and the water column slides over the bed.

Only `bottom` inside the `ImmersedBoundaryCondition`, matching what NumericalEarth's own
`ocean_simulation` builds: immersed side walls stay free-slip, which is a separate choice.

##### - `SurfaceWaveRadiation` (Chapman 1985) on `η`. Not stated here at all — Oceananigans pairs it
#####   onto every side where `U` or `V` carries a gravity-wave condition
#####   (`default_free_surface_boundary_conditions`), so a second statement could only disagree.
##### - `NormalRadiation` (Orlanski 1976 with Marchesiello et al. 2001 nudging) on the 3D velocity
#####   and on the tracers: radiate outgoing signals, nudge towards the exterior state on inflow.
#####
##### Naming a `U`/`V` condition also switches the split-explicit solver to `LocalHaloFilling`

One `AbstractBoundaryConditionConfig`'s contribution, as a nested named tuple keyed by field and
then by side: `(u = (top = …, bottom = …), T = (top = …,))`.

The per-piece hook. Named for what it returns — the per-field *sides* that
`field_boundary_conditions` materializes — rather than `boundary_conditions`, which is what it used
to be called. That name shadowed `Oceananigans.Fields.boundary_conditions`, so it was the one
FjordSim hook that could not be re-exported and had to be reached as
`FjordSim.BoundaryConditions.boundary_conditions`; and any caller binding a local of that name
shadowed the hook it was trying to call.

`boundary_config` is the setup's `AbstractBoundaryDataConfig`, or `nothing` — what a piece reads
`open_edges` from. It was the *forcing* config while the boundary dataset and the open edge both hung
off that one; the arity is unchanged, so an out-of-tree piece that ignores this argument, as both
built-in pieces below do, is unaffected. One that reads it now receives the boundary config.

`boundaries` is the prepared open-boundary state — the `NamedTuple` of reduced `FieldTimeSeries`
`FjordSim.Forcing.boundary_series` returns, or `nothing` for a setup with no boundary data. Passed
in rather than read here for the same reason `forcing` is: `build_simulation` is where the
`start_date` every time axis is zeroed at is known, and a config that read the file itself would
have to be told that instant a second time.

The five-argument form is the fallback, and forwards to the six-argument one *without* `boundaries`,
so a boundary config that ignores the prepared state — the built-in `AirSeaFluxes` and
`QuadraticBottomDrag`, or an out-of-tree config with a constant exterior — implements the shorter
signature and never sees it.

Declared with no six-argument method beyond that forwarding, so a subtype that implements neither
fails as a `MethodError` naming the hook.

    OpenLateralBoundaryFromData(; inflow_timescale, outflow_timescale)

The domain's open edge, with every exterior value read from the prepared open-boundary file.

Four groups on **each** edge the setup's `AbstractBoundaryDataConfig` names: a Flather condition on the
barotropic transport (from `ubar`/`vbar` and `eta`), and Orlanski radiation with nudging on the normal
3D velocity, on the tangential 3D velocity, and on every simulated tracer. Oceananigans adds the
Chapman condition on `η` itself, on every side carrying a gravity-wave transport condition — so a
domain in the open ocean naming all four edges needs nothing extra here or there.

The result is a boundary water, heat and salt actually cross — the
first version of this config, `OpenLateralBoundary`, put `NormalFlowBoundaryCondition(nothing)` on the
normal velocity, which is a closed wall, so only the tracers there were ever open.

The values come from the boundary data config a setup names on its `FjordConfig`, read by
`FjordSim.Forcing.boundary_series` and handed in by `build_simulation` — hourly NorKyst for the
built-in setups, because a Flather boundary without a tide is not worth prescribing and the interior
forcing is daily means.

Called `OpenLateralBoundaryFromForcing` while the boundary dataset hung off the forcing config. The
values were never forcing — they are a separate hourly file from a separate collection read by a
separate pipeline — and the name is the last place that said otherwise.

# Fields
- `inflow_timescale`: seconds to nudge towards the exterior state on inflow. Marchesiello et al.
  (2001) use about a day.
- `outflow_timescale`: seconds to nudge on outflow, where radiation should do the work instead. About
  a year in the same reference; `Inf` is pure radiation.

Both are fields rather than derivations, unlike the single `relaxation_timescale` this used to take
from the forcing config: a genuinely open boundary treats inflow and outflow differently, and the
outflow rate is information no other config states. Nothing in this stack has a default, so a setup
states both.

edges is the same `recursive_merge` as within one, and it composes rather than colliding: on a domain
open to the south and the west, `u` picks up a *tangential* condition at `.south` and a *normal* one at
`.west`, and each tracer picks up both sides. A corner cell is the one place two edges' conditions meet,
and which of them fills it is Oceananigans' halo-fill order rather than anything stated here.

    field_boundary_conditions(config, grid, forcing, boundary_config, tracers, boundaries)

The boundary conditions a whole `AbstractBoundaryConditionSetConfig` describes, materialized into
the `NamedTuple` a model constructor consumes.

The set-level hook, and a separate name from `boundary_condition_sides` on purpose: one function
returning a nested named tuple for one piece and a materialized one for a set of them would be two
shapes behind a single name.

Declared with no method, so a set config that does not implement it fails as a `MethodError` naming
the hook.

"""
    MergedBoundaryConditions(pieces...)

The built-in `AbstractBoundaryConditionSetConfig`: merge every piece's contribution with
`recursive_merge`, then materialize each field's sides into `FieldBoundaryConditions`.

Merging is last-wins per leaf, so argument order is precedence order. Naming no pieces at all is a
valid statement — a model with default boundary conditions everywhere — and yields `(;)`.

A struct rather than the bare `Tuple` this used to dispatch on. A `Tuple` is not a type any subtype
can specialize, so the merge strategy and the `FieldBoundaryConditions` result shape were fixed for
every model FjordSim could ever assemble; and it said nothing about what the tuple *was*. A model
whose boundary objects are something else, or that wants precedence resolved another way, is now a
sibling of this type.

The materialized result may name barotropic `U`/`V` and `η` as well as the prognostic fields, which
`HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` accepts: it regularizes them through `assumed_field_location` and hands
`bcs.U`/`bcs.V` to the split-explicit free surface.
