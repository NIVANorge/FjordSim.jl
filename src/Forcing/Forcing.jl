Only dimensionally valid for a tracer-like field: a velocity tendency needs acceleration units,
which nothing here supplies. `ForcingFromFile` is generic in `field_name`, so this is reachable for
any field whose `λ` happens to fall in `λ > 1` — it is the caller's responsibility to only route a
field here when `flux` really is a flux density for that field. There is currently no producer of
this `λ` regime at all — `prepared_variable` writes zeros and the river forcing writes

This is not `NumericalEarth`'s `inpaint_mask!`: that re-`NaN`s every masked cell before
propagating horizontally, discarding its own `continue_downwards!` pass, so a fully masked level
has nothing to spread from. With the default `NearestNeighborInpainting(Inf)` it then never
terminates, and with a finite cap `_fill_nans!` turns the level into zeros — a plausible-looking
fabricated temperature or salinity.

    prepare_forcing(target_grid, config::AbstractForcingConfig)

Regrid the source files already downloaded into `forcing_directory(config)` onto `target_grid`,
and write a forcing NetCDF at `forcing_path(config)` that `forcing_from_file` reads directly.

The dataset enters only through the three hooks `forcing_variable_names`,
`forcing_time_steps` and `forcing_source_grid`; everything after them is the same for every
source.

`target_grid` should be the `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` the simulation runs on, so the output
dimensions and land mask match it exactly — the mask comes from `peripheral_node`, the same
predicate the model uses. Interpolation is one trilinear `Oceananigans.Fields.interpolate` call
per target cell, taken in the source projection and clamped at the vertical ends. Cells the model
treats as land are written as `NaN`, which `forcing_from_file` reads back as the `value > -990`
sentinel the forcing kernel skips. Days missing from the download are interpolated between their
neighbours.

`config.architecture` selects where the interpolation kernel runs, via
`interpolation_architecture`, and is independent of `target_grid`, which must stay on the CPU:
building the masks walks `peripheral_node` cell by cell, which needs scalar access to the
bathymetry. Only the target nodes, mask and output buffer are moved to the interpolation device,
and only the finished slab comes back for each write, so a GPU run keeps the same streaming
memory profile.

Relaxation lambdas are written as **zero everywhere**. The interior sponge band this file used to
carry along the open edge is gone: the open lateral boundary now nudges towards hourly exterior data at
the boundary itself (`NormalRadiation`, `GravityWaveRadiation`), and a band relaxing the same
variables a few cells inside would fight it. `add_rivers` writes the only nonzero lambdas the file
ever carries, so the `*_lambda` variables exist for that step and for
`forcing_from_file`'s own contract, and the prepared values are otherwise read only as initial
conditions (`FromForcing`).

# Why the interpolation is not `NumericalEarth`'s

A source grid in projected meters — NorKyst's is rotated about 59 degrees from east in the
Oslofjord region — cannot be a `LatitudeLongitudeGrid`; treating its 2D `lon`/`lat` as separable
is wrong by roughly 100 grid cells. `NumericalEarth`'s dataset path (`native_grid`,
`set!(field, metadata)`, `DatasetRestoring`) always builds a `LatitudeLongitudeGrid`, and
`Oceananigans`' field-to-field `interpolate!` cannot bridge lon/lat and projected meters, so
neither applies here. The NORA3 atmosphere avoids this only because its file has already been
regridded to a regular lon/lat grid upstream. What does work is projecting the target nodes and
interpolating against a `RectilinearGrid` in projected meters; see `source_field_grid` and
`interpolate_to_target!`.

# Coverage
`coverage` is the `(first, last)` calendar interval the run needs, from `coverage_window`. The time
axis is padded to reach both ends by replicating the nearest step; `nothing` prepares exactly the
downloaded range. See `pad_time_steps`.

# The open edges
`edges` are the lateral boundaries the domain is open on, from the setup's open-boundary data config,
or `nothing` for a setup that names none and is therefore closed all round. They reach `water_mask`,
which unmasks each of those edges' velocity face rows so the prepared values are not dropped exactly
where an open boundary reads them. A keyword rather than a field of `config`, because which edges are
open is a property of the domain and its boundary data, not of the forcing dataset.

This is the setup-level driver, the same shape as `download_forcing(config::FjordConfig)`. The

    pad_time_steps(steps, coverage)

Extend `steps` to span `coverage`, replicating the nearest step at each end that falls short. A
`nothing` coverage leaves `steps` alone.

Written after `daily_time_steps` so its whole-day cadence check sees only the downloaded times: a
pad step is deliberately off that cadence whenever the run's window is.

The pad carries the *same* source records and blend weight as the step it copies, so the written
field is identical to its neighbour rather than a re-derived approximation of it. That is what makes
the padding a statement about the time axis alone.

The reason this exists is that a run's window rarely lines up with a dataset's records — NorKyst's
first daily record here is at 12:00, so a run starting at 00:00 on the same day has no forcing for
its first half-day. `forcing_from_file` reads with `Cyclical()` time indexing, which does not fail
outside its data but wraps to the far end, so the shortfall would be filled with the following
December rather than reported. Padding puts a real record at both ends instead, which is what lets
`Simulations.validate_time_coverage` stay a hard check.

That last point is also why a pad may reach **at most one record spacing** past the downloaded axis.
Unbounded, this would defeat the very check it exists to serve: a window running a year past the
data would be "covered" by one replicated December, `forcing_date_range` would report the invented
span, `validate_time_coverage` would pass, and the run would interpolate twelve months between two
identical records — quietly worse than the wrap. Overshooting by more than a spacing is a missing
download, and is reported as one.

Water flag per cell of `target_grid` at the location `(LX, LY, Center)`, taken from

separates is inactive, and `PartialCellBottom` decides "inactive" with its own
`minimum_fractional_cell_height` rather than a hand-rolled cell-center test.

`edges` names the open lateral boundaries, whose outermost face rows `open_boundary_water!` restores —
one `Symbol`, a collection of them, or `nothing`. A setup naming no open-boundary data restores none:
with no exterior state there is nothing to read at those rows, so every lateral boundary is a closed
wall and the peripheral mask stands as it is. A domain in the open ocean names all four and gets every
face row back.

Only the component staggered across a given edge is affected, so the four restores are independent and
their order does not matter — `u` is touched by `:west` and `:east`, `v` by `:south` and `:north`, and
a tracer by none of them.

right, but `edge` is where the domain is open and the normal velocity carries a
`NormalFlowBoundaryCondition`, so leaving that row masked would drop the data exactly where it is
needed — both for the prepared forcing's initial conditions and for the boundary file. Only the

levels, so that `interpolate` sees the levels the data is actually defined at.

Oceananigans grids are specified by faces with centers at face midpoints, while a source's
`depth` values *are* centers of a strongly non-uniform axis. Solving `c_k = (f_k + f_{k+1})/2`
leaves one free parameter `s = f_1`, with `f_k = (-1)^(k-1) s + g_k`, and a positive cell
thickness requires `f_k < c_k`. Each level therefore bounds `s` from one side, alternating with
parity. For NorKyst's 16 levels the resulting interval is about one metre wide in a 3 km domain —
it exists, but it is a property of MET's depth list rather than of this code, so an empty
interval is an error rather than a silently misplaced grid.

The projected coordinates are regular, so this is a legal `RectilinearGrid` and

NorKyst's grid is rotated about 59 degrees from east in the Oslofjord region, which also rules
out the `NumericalEarth` dataset path, whose `native_grid` is always a `LatitudeLongitudeGrid`.

`RectilinearGrid` in the same projected meters, so one trilinear call covers both the horizontal

`launch!` takes its work size from `size(output)` and its device from `architecture`; the grid
argument is unused for a size-tuple work spec, so the source grid is passed for consistency.
