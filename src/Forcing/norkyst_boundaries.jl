# A *different* NorKyst collection from `norkyst.jl`'s. That one reads `fou-hi/norkyst800m`,
# whose files are `..._avg.an.*` — daily averages, one record each. This one reads
# `fou-hi/norkyst800m-1h`, whose files are `..._his.an.*` — 24 hourly instants each. The interior
# forcing wants the daily means; an open boundary wants the hourly instants, because a daily mean has
# the tide averaged out of it and elevation with no tide is not worth prescribing.
#
# NorKyst's own lateral boundary conditions, from its global attributes, are the same scheme set
# FjordSim now applies at its own edge: `zeta: Che` (Chapman), `ubar/vbar: Shc` (Flather-family),
# `u/v/temp/salt: RadNud` (Orlanski radiation plus nudging).

the same fields on the same polar-stereographic grid with the same projection variable and depth

    NorKystBoundariesConfig

Configuration for downloading and subsetting hourly NorKyst-800m data along one open lateral
boundary.

`output_directory`, `output_file` and `plot_file` are names relative to `data_root`, resolved by
`boundary_data_directory`, `boundary_data_path` and `plot_path`. Setting one to an absolute path
overrides `data_root` for that entry only.

# Fields
- `data_root`: Directory holding this setup's boundary files. Required.
- `output_directory`: Name of the directory the monthly downloads are written to. Required.
- `output_file`: Name of the prepared boundary NetCDF written by `prepare_boundaries`.
- `plot_file`: Name of the diagnostic boundary plot.
- `open_edges`: Lateral boundaries the domain is open on, each one of `:south`, `:north`, `:west` or
  `:east`. Write one `Symbol` for a single edge or a collection for several — a domain in the open
  ocean names all four — and the constructor normalizes either to a `Vector{Symbol}`. Required, and
  stated only here: the download subsets a band along each, `prepare_boundaries` regrids onto each and
  writes them all into one file, `water_mask` unmasks each edge's velocity face row for both this
  pipeline and the interior forcing's, and the open lateral boundary condition puts its schemes on
  every one of them.
- `margin`: Degrees of latitude/longitude the download reaches past the boundary row, on both
  sides. Must leave room for the source cells the bilinear interpolation reads around the row —
  NorKyst's spacing is 800 m, so a few hundredths of a degree. Kept small because the download is
  hourly: the whole domain box at 24 records a day is more than twenty times the interior forcing,
  while a thin band is a tenth of the box.
- `architecture`: Where `prepare_boundaries` interpolates — `:auto`, `:cpu` or `:gpu`, resolved by
  `interpolation_architecture`.
- `catalog_url`, `opendap_url`: The hourly NorKyst collection's own public endpoints; the only
  defaulted fields.
- `parameters`: Source variable names to extract. Required.
- `years`: Calendar years to download. Required.

    boundary_source_slab(config::NorKystBoundariesConfig, reader, step, source_name)

As the default for every variable except `ubar` and `vbar`, which are rotated from NorKyst's own
curvilinear axes to eastward/northward before being returned.

ROMS writes `ubar`/`vbar` along its grid's x and y axes, and NorKyst's grid is rotated about 59
degrees from east in the Oslofjord region — so `vbar` is very nearly the *eastward* barotropic
velocity there, not the northward one. Left unrotated it reaches `GravityWaveRadiation` as the
exterior transport normal to a south edge, which is a signal of roughly the right magnitude and
essentially no correlation with the true normal flow (measured: 0.03) — a persistent spurious
transport across the boundary rather than a small error.

The 3D `u_eastward`/`v_northward` need none of this, being derotated upstream by met.no. The
collection publishes no barotropic equivalent, which is the only reason this method exists.

The rotation is applied on the native source grid, before any interpolation, for the same reason
`nora3_source.jl` rotates NORA3's winds there: the angle is a property of the source geometry, and
after interpolation the two components live on different edge rows under different masks and can no
longer be combined.

`angle` is read from whichever file the reader has open rather than cached, which is safe because it
is grid geometry — every monthly file of one subset carries the same plane — and cheap, being a single
46x63 plane against seven full slabs of real work in the same step. It is read *after* the two
`blended_slab` calls, since those are what leave the reader pointing at a file at all.
