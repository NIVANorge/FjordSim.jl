Holds only the knob, not the object — `SplitExplicitFreeSurface(grid, cfl = ...)` needs the grid,
which does not exist until `coupled_simulation` builds it, so `free_surface` is what does that
building once the grid is in hand.

    BoundarySponge(; base, width_cells, viscosity, diffusivity)

The one built-in `AbstractClosureConfig`: `base`, plus a harmonic horizontal viscosity and
diffusivity that ramp to zero inward from every open lateral edge.

An open lateral boundary radiates as well as admits, and a radiation condition diagnosing its own
phase speed against a tide, a wind and a river plume leaves grid-scale noise on the boundary row
that the interior has to absorb. Without a sponge nothing absorbs it: the biharmonic viscosity a
setup names for the interior damps the grid scale but is not what removes a metre-per-second
boundary response, and the open-boundary nudging pulls the boundary row towards the exterior data
rather than smoothing along it. What that noise does, given time, is accumulate in the poorly
ventilated bottom cells nearest the boundary until their density anomaly drives its own
circulation.

A *viscous* sponge rather than a tracer relaxation band, deliberately: a band relaxing T and S a few
cells inside the domain fights the boundary condition, which is nudging the same variables at the
boundary itself towards the same data. Viscosity and diffusivity only smooth; they name no target
and so cannot disagree with one.

# Fields
- `base`: the closure, or tuple of closures, the sponge is added to. Passed through untouched.
- `width_cells`: how far the ramp reaches, in grid cells.
- `viscosity`, `diffusivity`: `ν` and `κ` in m² s⁻¹ *at* the open edge, falling to zero at
  `width_cells`.

`viscosity` is bounded by explicit horizontal-diffusion stability, not by taste: the time step must
satisfy `Δt ≤ Δx² / 4ν`, which on a 193 m cell is 310 s at `ν = 30` and 155 s at `ν = 60`. A value
that pushes that bound under the time-stepping config's `max_time_step` caps the run's time step
instead of the CFL doing it, so raise it only alongside that number.

The edges are **not** a field. They come from the setup's `AbstractBoundaryDataConfig` through
`open_edges`, which is where a domain's open boundaries are stated, so a setup that later opens a
second edge sponges both without a second edit. A setup naming no boundary config has no open edge,
and `model_closure` then returns `base` unchanged.

# The alternative, and what it would buy

The other standard shape for this is a *restoring* sponge: a `Relaxation` forcing over a mask near
the boundary, pulling each field towards a prescribed exterior state. NumericalEarth's
`DatasetRestoring` is the ready-made version, and a regional Arctic configuration using it nudges
`T` and `S` at `1/1day` but `u` and `v` at `1/20minutes` over a Gaussian mask four cells wide — that
is, velocities some seventy times harder than tracers, on the reasoning that it is the *momentum*
field near the boundary that has to stay matched to what is prescribed.

That asymmetry is worth taking seriously, because it is the same conclusion the Oslofjord diagnosis
reached from the other end: the boundary row's velocity was 3–7x the interior's, and the tracer
extremes followed from it rather than the reverse. It is why `viscosity` is set above `diffusivity`
here rather than equal to it.

FjordSim cannot simply adopt the restoring form, and the reason is worth knowing before anyone tries.
A relaxation forcing needs a *target* in the sponge band, and the exterior state this setup prepares
exists only **at** the boundary row — `boundary_series` returns reduced `FieldTimeSeries`, one cell
thick. The only three-dimensional target available is `forcing.nc`, whose lambdas
`prepare_forcing` deliberately writes as zero; reinstating a band there for `u` and `v` alone would
be the faithful translation, and would *not* run into the objection that killed the old tracer band,
since that band fought the open boundary's own tracer nudging and a velocity band does not touch
tracers. It is the obvious next thing to try if this sponge proves too blunt.

The sponge's `ν` and `κ` at one node, in Oceananigans' **discrete** diffusivity form.

Discrete rather than continuous, and not by preference: `ScalarDiffusivity` only threads
`parameters` through when `discrete_form = true`. With `discrete_form = false` it stores the bare
function and calls it as `ν(λ, φ, z, t)` — four arguments, `parameters` silently dropped, despite
the constructor accepting them. A five-argument method then never matches, and because the call is
inside a GPU kernel the `MethodError` surfaces as `InvalidIRError: unsupported call to an unknown
function (call to jl_f_throw_methoderror)` from a frame elsewhere in the tendency kernel — which
says nothing about the closure at all. The discrete form is the path that actually carries
`parameters`, so it is the one to use.

`ℓx, ℓy, ℓz` are the location Oceananigans wants the coefficient at, which differs between the
viscosity's four staggered flavours; `node` is what turns them into coordinates. The vertical node
is unused — the sponge is a horizontal ramp at every depth.

What the model *is*: a `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` inside a NumericalEarth `OceanSeaIceModel`.

Holds the components that depend on neither the grid nor the device, so they are stored as the
objects `coupled_simulation` consumes rather than as knobs it has to interpret. `free_surface` is
the one exception: it is itself an `AbstractFreeSurfaceConfig`, built by its own `free_surface(config,
grid)` hook rather than stored ready-made, for exactly the reason `coupled_simulation` — and not this
struct — is what assembles the model: `SplitExplicitFreeSurface` needs the grid, which only exists
once `coupled_simulation` is called.

**No field has a default**, deliberately. Every one is a scientific choice about a particular fjord,
and a default would let the next setup silently inherit it, so a setup that forgets one gets an
`UndefKeywordError` naming it rather than a plausible-looking run. `extra_kwargs` is no exception: a
setup that passes nothing extra still writes `extra_kwargs = (;)`.

Ten type parameters. Nine are components, and the tenth is the collapse the count was always headed
for: rather than one field per remaining constructor keyword — `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` alone
has eight this does not name — `extra_kwargs` carries all of them in one `NamedTuple`. **Do not add
an eleventh**; anything new goes inside `extra_kwargs`, which is exactly what it is for. The "config"
testset guards the count.

# `extra_kwargs`

A `NamedTuple` with up to four slots, one per constructor `coupled_simulation` calls, each itself a
`NamedTuple` splatted into that call:

| Slot | Reaches | Keywords it is for |
|---|---|---|
| `ocean_model` | `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` | `clock`, `timestepper`, `particles`, `velocities`, `pressure`, `closure_fields`, `auxiliary_fields`, `vertical_coordinate` |
| `ocean_simulation` | `Simulation(ocean_model; …)` | `verbose`, `stop_iteration`, `wall_time_limit`, `align_time_step`, `minimum_relative_step` |
| `coupled_model` | `OceanSeaIceModel` | `land`, `interfaces`, `ocean_reference_density`, `ocean_heat_capacity`, `sea_ice_reference_density`, `sea_ice_heat_capacity`, and its `interface_kw…` |
| `coupled_simulation` | `Simulation(coupled_model; …)` | as `ocean_simulation` |

An omitted slot is empty. The escape hatch can only **add**: the constructor rejects a slot key that
duplicates a keyword `coupled_simulation` already passes, because a splat wins over an explicit
keyword, so a stray `tracers` in `ocean_model` would silently disagree with `model_tracers` — which
`build_simulation` already used to build the forcing and the boundary conditions before the model
existed.

The keyword constructor is hand-written rather than `Base.@kwdef`, because `extra_kwargs` needs
validating at construction. That also puts this type in the same category as `SnapshotWriter` and
`ProgressCallback` rather than `SimulationConfig`'s: the `Base.@kwdef`-on-a-parametric-struct rule
that makes `stop_time = 3600` a `MethodError` there does not apply here.

It exists for the fields NetCDF cannot take. Oceananigans' NetCDF writer cannot emit a
`(Center, Center, Nothing)` *user output* at all — the free surface `η` asks for a singleton
`z_aaf = [0.0]` while the grid's own vertical coordinate already owns that name with the real faces,
and the writer raises rather than reconciling them. Measured: it fails beside the 3D fields, in a
file of its own, and with `include_grid_metrics = false`. `bottom_height` is the same location and
*is* written, because grid metrics take a different path, so this is an upstream defect in the
user-output path rather than something a setup can configure around. JLD2 serializes the array and
has no dimension table to collide with.

Use it for `η` and for anything else z-reduced; keep the 3D fields in `SnapshotWriter`, whose NetCDF
output is what every downstream reader here expects.

One `NetCDFWriter` per station rather than one for all of them, because Oceananigans takes a single
`indices` per file and a station is `indices = (i, j, :)`. So this writer occupies one
`output_writers` key per station — `writer_keys` reports them all, which is what keeps
`validate_writers` able to catch a collision.

# Fields
- `name`: the stem of the `output_writers` keys, each suffixed with the station's `station_tag`.
- `output_file`: resolved by `results_path` and then suffixed per station, so one writer named
  `moorings.nc` writes `moorings_<tag>_Km1.nc`, `moorings_<tag>_Kn2.nc` and so on.
- `variables`: field names as `Symbol`s, resolved against the model by `snapshot_outputs` exactly as
  a `SnapshotWriter`'s are.
- `stations`: the positions to write at.
- `interval`, `overwrite_existing`: the schedule and the clobber policy.
- `search_radius`: how many cells out to look for water when a station's own cell is dry. Stations
  sit at the coast — a beach thermometer, a mooring in a narrow sound — and at a couple of hundred
  metres per cell several of them land on the wrong side of the model coastline. A station with no
  water in reach is dropped with a warning rather than failing the run, since one unusable station
  is not a reason to lose a multi-week simulation.

    CheckpointWriter(; interval, cleanup)

A JLD2 checkpoint of the coupled model's prognostic state, on a `TimeInterval` schedule.

Naming one is what makes a run resumable; a setup that names none writes no checkpoints at all,
which is how "checkpointing off" is now spelled. `pickup` without one is a configuration error
rather than a run that fails on its first `run!`.

Oceananigans 0.110 checkpoints *only* `prognostic_state(simulation)`, so the `Checkpointer`
docstring's warning that objects containing functions cannot be serialized does not apply here:
`ForcingFromFile`, its `FieldTimeSeries` backend and the `FreshwaterExchange` in the tracer top
boundary conditions are all outside that state. CATKE's diffusivities and its `e` tracer are inside
it, which is why a checkpoint is a few hundred MB on a real grid and why `cleanup` exists.

`cleanup` is the field that decides how many of them survive, since a checkpoint's filename carries
the iteration and every fire writes a new one: `true` deletes all but the newest after each write.
There is deliberately no `overwrite_existing` twin of the snapshot writer's. `Checkpointer` accepts
one, but never reads it — `write_output!` opens `jldopen(path, "w")` regardless — so naming it here
would advertise a choice the run does not have.

    SimulationConfig(; results_root, architecture, model, boundary_conditions, writers, ...)

Simulation configuration: how a setup whose data is already prepared is run.

**No field has a default**, here and in each of the four nested configs. Every knob is a scientific
choice about a particular fjord, and a default would let one setup silently inherit another's — so a
setup that forgets one gets an `UndefKeywordError` naming it rather than a plausible-looking run.
The setup file is the complete statement of what the simulation is; nothing about it is hidden here.

The fields split into five nested configs and the run control that ties them together, and the split
is by *what dispatches on what*. `model` is assembled by `coupled_simulation`, `boundary_conditions`
by `field_boundary_conditions`, each writer by `attach_writer!`, each callback by
`attach_callback!`, and `time_stepping` by `attach_time_stepping!` — five generic functions, so a
different model, a new boundary-condition piece, another kind of output or a different diagnostic is
a new subtype rather than an edit to `build_simulation`.

# Fields
- `results_root`: the directory every writer, and the run log, resolves against.
- `architecture`: `:auto`, `:cpu` or `:gpu`, resolved by `simulation_architecture`. A `Symbol`
  rather than a live `CPU()`/`GPU()` so this config's field types stay concrete and a setup file
  loads on a machine with no GPU.
- `model`: an `AbstractCoupledSimulationConfig`.
- `boundary_conditions`: an `AbstractBoundaryConditionSetConfig`, usually a
  `MergedBoundaryConditions` naming the pieces in precedence order.
- `writers`: a tuple of `AbstractWriterConfig`s. `()` writes nothing.
- `callbacks`: a tuple of `AbstractCallbackConfig`s. `()` reports nothing.
- `time_stepping`: an `AbstractTimeSteppingConfig`.
- `initial_conditions`: where the ocean state starts from — a `NamedTuple` of constants, fields or
  functions, a `FromForcing`, or a `FromResults`. `build_simulation` puts it through
  `resolve_initial_conditions`, so what reaches `coupled_simulation` is always a `NamedTuple` `set!`
  accepts.
- `start_date`: the calendar instant model time zero stands for.
- `stop_time`: seconds of simulated time one pass through the run window lasts.
- `loops`: how many times to run that window, carrying the ocean state across each restart. `1`
  runs it once. See `run_simulation`.
- `pickup`: resume from the newest checkpoint under `results_root` instead of starting fresh.
  Requires a `CheckpointWriter`.

Nothing that could be derived from another config is a field at all: which forcing file, which open
boundary and which atmosphere reader all come from `forcing_config` and `atmosphere_config`.

`start_date` is a field rather than something derived from an input file because every prepared
file has its *own* first record, and each reader used to zero its own axis there: the Oslofjord
forcing starts at 12:00 and its atmosphere at 00:00, which silently ran the two twelve hours out
of phase. One stated instant is the only thing they can all agree on, and
`validate_time_coverage` checks each file actually spans `[start_date, start_date + stop_time]`
rather than letting `Cyclical()` wrap the shortfall.

Every duration is in seconds. `Base.@kwdef` on a *parametric* struct generates a constructor that
does not convert, so `stop_time = 3600` is a `MethodError` where `stop_time = 1hour` is fine — write
durations with `Oceananigans.Units`, whose constants are already `Float64`. `loops` is the exception,
being an `Int` already, and the nested configs are the other one: each has a hand-written keyword
constructor that converts, so an integer duration is fine in a writer or a time-stepping config.

the `OceanSeaIceModel` is what a resumable state actually is, and `run!(…; pickup)` looks for its
checkpointer in `simulation.output_writers`.

Replaced rather than closed and popped, unlike the snapshot writer: a `Checkpointer` holds no open
file handle, and its schedule is rebuilt with it.

`Checkpointer`'s `overwrite_existing` is left at its default, since it is a field the writer stores
and never reads — see `CheckpointWriter`.

`FreezingLimitedOceanTemperature` — which is a liquidus and nothing else — makes it throw
`has no field clock`. Dispatching on whether the component *has* a clock keeps this module free of

    restart_loop!(simulation, config, loop)

Send `simulation` back to the start of its window for repetition `loop`, keeping the ocean state.

Every clock in the coupled model goes back to zero — the coupled model's own, and each component's,
found by sweeping its properties rather than naming them. Nothing else is reset: the ocean's
velocities, tracers, CATKE diffusivities and free surface all carry over, which is the whole point.
`stop_time` is untouched, and so is `simulation.Δt`, so the time-step wizard keeps the step it
converged on instead of re-ramping from one second.

Two things then have to be prodded by hand, and both are silent if they are not.

The prescribed atmosphere and radiation hold their `FieldTimeSeries` window, and rewinding a clock
does not refill it. `time_step!(::EarthSystemModel)` assembles surface fluxes in
`maybe_prepare_first_time_step!` *before* it steps the atmosphere, so without this the first step of
each loop would be forced by last December — which is exactly why `NumericalEarth`'s own
`reset_clock!` ends with an `update_state!` on the atmosphere.

And the ocean is a `Simulation` of its own, which `run!` never touches: `run!` clears `initialized`
on the coupled simulation only, so `time_step!(ocean_sim)` would skip `initialize!` and the fresh
snapshot writer would never have its schedule initialized or its `t = 0` record written.

`clock.last_Δt` comes back as `Inf`, which makes the first step of each loop a forward Euler step.
That is both harmless and right: `G⁻` refers to a step taken under forcing a year away.

    build_simulation(config::FjordConfig)

Assemble the coupled simulation a setup describes, with its output writer, progress callback and

Split from `run_simulation` so a run can be inspected or stepped by hand:

```julia
simulation = build_simulation(oslofjorden())
run!(simulation)
```

Every input comes from the setup's own prepared files — `bathymetry_path`, the forcing file
`simulation_forcing_path` picks, and the atmosphere the `prescribed_atmosphere` and
`prescribed_radiation` hooks read. A missing prerequisite is reported naming the step that writes
it, rather than as a read error from deep inside NetCDF.

The initial conditions go through `resolve_initial_conditions`, so a `FromForcing` or `FromResults`
is read here — where the grid and the forcing path are known — and what `coupled_simulation`
receives is always a plain `NamedTuple`. Note that `pickup` supersedes them: the checkpoint restores
the state that `set!` had just written.

setup names rivers, and `prepare_atmosphere` if it names an atmosphere.

# Looping

Each repetition replays `[start_date, start_date + stop_time]` with the ocean state carried over, so
`loops > 1` is a spin-up: one forcing year run again and again until the deep basins stop drifting.
`restart_loop!` does the carrying over — the clock goes back to zero, the state does not — and each
repetition writes its own file, so the loops can be compared rather than overwriting one another.

The clock is reset rather than left to run on for `loops * stop_time` because that keeps the run
inside `[t¹, tᴺ]` of every prepared file. Both readers use `Cyclical()` time indexing, and a
monotonic clock would lean on its wrap-around, whose period is inferred from the file's own axis and
so stops matching the loop the moment a file is padded to a different window.

Assemble the coupled `Simulation` a model config describes, on `grid`, and return it without

The low-level entry point, dispatched on the model config and taking every grid-dependent component
already built — `build_simulation` is what takes a `FjordConfig` and derives them. Adding a
different kind of model is a new `AbstractCoupledSimulationConfig` subtype and a new method here;
neither `build_simulation` nor anything above it changes.

The method below builds a `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` inside a NumericalEarth `OceanSeaIceModel`.
Two of its components are resolved here rather than arriving prebuilt, and for the same reason:
`model.free_surface`'s `free_surface(config, grid)` hook, because `SplitExplicitFreeSurface` needs
the grid, and `model.closure` through `model_closure`, because a closure may need the grid *and* the
open edges. `model_closure`'s fallback is the identity, so a plain Oceananigans closure — which is
what most setups write — passes through untouched.

`boundary_config` is the setup's `AbstractBoundaryDataConfig`, or `nothing`. It is passed rather than
read, for the same reason `boundary_condition_sides` takes it: the edges are stated once, on that
config, and a second statement of them could only disagree.
