    oslofjorden()

The Oslofjord setup: Geonorge Sjøkart Dybdedata bathymetry, NorKyst-800m forcing with NVE rivers,
and NORA3 atmosphere, on a 240 x 520 x 24 grid covering 10.2-11.02°E, 59.0-59.93°N.

The rivers are **discovered**, not stated: `minimum_discharge = 0.5` has `add_rivers` read NVE's
ELVIS river network and REGINE catchments for this domain and place every mouth at or above that
size — 21 of them, carrying 99.6 % of the domain's 1179 m³/s — so no river coordinate appears in
this file. All 21 are forced whether or not they appear below: an outlet discovery finds already
gets a plume and a catchment-normal size on its own, with or without an override. The `outlets`
list is eight overrides, keyed by `vassdragsnr`, and their almost-universal job is attaching a real
HydAPI gauge — `discharge_station`, sometimes `temperature_station` — to a mouth discovery already
found, so it is forced by an observed series instead of by its catchment normal; changing
`plume_depth` or splitting a discharge with `discharge_fraction` is the exception three of the
eight need (Glomma's two mouths, Drammenselva), not what the list is for. The other thirteen
discovered mouths run freshwater-only, sized by their own catchment. Only the gauge half needs a
credential, an NVE HydAPI key in `NVE_API_KEY` (free at https://hydapi.nve.no/Users); the map
services are open, and nothing else here needs one either.

The river config gets the same `data_root` as the rest of the setup, so the cached NVE responses
land alongside it rather than being shared from elsewhere, and it writes `forcing_rivers_nve.nc`
rather than `forcing_rivers.nc` so the OF800 file this setup used to produce is left intact for
comparison. `simulation_forcing_path` returns whichever file the named river config points at, so
that is the one the run reads.

It also names a `simulation_config`, so `run_simulation` works once the preparation steps have
run. Nothing about the run has a default, so every knob is stated here and nowhere else — split
across four nested configs by what dispatches on it: `CoupledHydrostaticSimulation` is what the
model is, the `boundary_conditions` tuple is what bounds it, the `writers` tuple is what it writes,
and `AdaptiveTimeStep` is how its clock advances. Results go to `~/FjordSim_results/oslofjorden/`,
separate from the input data root, and each writer's file carries the launch tag so runs do not
overwrite each other.

`start_date` and `stop_time` also decide what the prepare steps write: they pad the forcing and
atmosphere time axes to span exactly this window, so changing either means re-running
`prepare_forcing`, `add_rivers` and `prepare_atmosphere`. The window here is the whole of 2020, which
needs that padding at both ends — files prepared against the old 12:00-anchored window will be
rejected by `validate_time_coverage` until those three steps have been re-run.
