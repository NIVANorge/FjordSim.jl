Prepare the input data for a FjordSim setup, and run it.

Usage:
  julia --project -m FjordSim SUBCOMMAND --config SETUP

Subcommands, in the order a setup is prepared and run:
  prepare_bathymetry    Regrid the bathymetry source onto the setup's grid. Downloads the Geonorge
                        Sjøkart FileGDB on first use (~2.3 GB).
  download_forcing      Download and subset the forcing dataset over the setup's region and years.
                        A setup with no forcing config does nothing.
  prepare_forcing       Regrid the download onto the simulation grid. Needs prepare_bathymetry.
                        Where the interpolation runs is the forcing config's `architecture` field,
                        not a command-line option. A setup with no forcing config does nothing.
  add_rivers            Write river relaxation into a copy of the prepared forcing, leaving the
                        original untouched — or, when the river config is `standalone`, into a
                        forcing file carrying only rivers, needing no prepared forcing at all. A
                        setup with no rivers does nothing.
  download_boundaries   Download and subset hourly source data along the open lateral boundary. A
                        thin band rather than the whole domain, since the exterior state an open
                        boundary needs has to resolve the tide and daily means do not. A setup
                        naming no boundary config does nothing.
  prepare_boundaries    Regrid the download onto the open edge of the simulation grid. Needs
                        prepare_bathymetry and download_boundaries.
  download_atmosphere   Download and subset the atmosphere dataset. By far the slowest step: NORA3
                        is served one file per forecast lead hour, so a year is close to 10000
                        OPeNDAP reads. A month already downloaded is skipped, so an interrupted run
                        resumes. A setup with no atmosphere does nothing.
  prepare_atmosphere    Regrid the download onto a regular longitude/latitude grid. Needs
                        download_atmosphere but not prepare_bathymetry, and is cheap to re-run
                        after changing `resolution` or `padding`.
  run_simulation        Build and run the coupled simulation, writing NetCDF snapshots into the
                        setup's results directory. Needs every step above that the setup
                        configures: prepare_bathymetry, prepare_forcing, add_rivers if it names
                        rivers, prepare_boundaries if it names open-boundary data, and
                        prepare_atmosphere if it names an atmosphere. Where it runs
                        is the simulation config's `architecture` field. A setup with no
                        simulation config does nothing.

Options:
  --config SETUP   Which setup to prepare. Required. One of: $(join(setup_names(), ", ")).
                   A path ending in .jl is loaded as an out-of-tree config file instead.
  -h, --help       Show this message.

Everything other than which setup to prepare is stated in the setup itself, so this is the whole
command-line surface. The same steps are available from the REPL:

  using FjordSim
  config = $(first(setup_names()))()
  prepare_bathymetry(config)
"""

"""
    log_path(config)

Where to write this run's transcript: `fjordsim_<run_tag>.log` under the setup's `results_root`, so a
log lands beside the output it describes rather than wherever the command happened to be run from,
and so each launch keeps its own transcript.

Takes the *simulation* config, because `results_root` and the run tag are its fields and only
`run_simulation` is logged: that is the one step whose failure is a stacktrace through the whole
coupled model, and the one step a setup without a simulation config does not run at all.
"""
log_path(config::AbstractSimulationConfig) =
    joinpath(config.results_root, string("fjordsim_", run_tag(config), ".log"))

"""
The width, in columns, the error reporter tells `showerror` it has.

`Base.type_depth_limit` floors this at 120, so a smaller number changes nothing. Stated explicitly
rather than left to `displaysize` so the log does not depend on how wide the terminal was — under the
tee `stdout` is a `Pipe`, which reports the 24x80 default anyway.
"""

"""
The seconds `show_compact_error` gives `showerror` before giving up on it. A GPU-kernel exception
raised after the CUDA context is already broken (e.g. a driver-level MMU fault) has been observed to
hang here indefinitely rather than print or raise — pretty-printing its message or backtrace can
apparently re-touch the dead context. `run_step` must still return promptly in that case, since
nothing past it (staging results out, marking the run failed) will happen while it is stuck.
"""
const SHOW_ERROR_TIMEOUT = 30.0

"""
    show_compact_error(io, exception, backtrace)

Report `exception` and its backtrace with the type parameters in each frame abbreviated to `{…}`.

Julia only abbreviates them when the IO carries `:stacktrace_types_limited`, which is what
`REPL.repl_display_error` sets and a script's bare `showerror` does not — which is why a stacktrace
through the coupled model spells out every parameter of every `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` and
`ImmersedBoundaryGrid` in it, and stays unreadable even in a file.

It shortens *frames*, not messages: a `GPUCompiler` `InvalidIRError` body is as long as it ever was.

`showerror` runs on a separate task capped at `SHOW_ERROR_TIMEOUT`: past that, or if the task itself
throws, a one-line fallback naming just the exception type is printed instead. The spawned task is
abandoned rather than killed — interrupting arbitrary code mid-flight is unsafe — but the process is
about to exit anyway, so a leaked task costs nothing.

    tee_output(f, log_file)

Run `f` with `stdout` and `stderr` redirected into `log_file`, still printing everything live to the
real `stdout`, and return whatever `f` returns.

`redirect_stdio` only accepts fd-backed streams, so the tee is a `Pipe` plus a task copying each
chunk to both destinations. Both streams share one pipe, so the log interleaves them in the order
they were written.

`log_file`'s directory is created if absent, since a setup's results directory need not exist
before its first run.

    run_step(driver, config, subcommand, setup)

Run one driver and return its exit code: 0 on success, 1 if it threw.

A step a setup opts out of — `add_rivers` on a setup with no rivers, the atmosphere steps on a setup
with no atmosphere — returns `nothing` from the driver and is reported here rather than raising,
because that is a property of the setup and not a failure.

A failure is caught rather than propagated: under `tee_output` an exception left to `Base._start`
would be printed after the redirect had already been torn down, so the error — the one thing worth
having in the log — would be the only thing missing from it.

`driver` runs through `Base.invokelatest` because `config` may carry types and methods that did not
exist until `fjord_config` loaded them: an out-of-tree `--config path.jl` file is `Base.include`d
from within this same `main` call, and any new struct or method it defines is invisible to code
already running in the world active when `main` started — a plain `driver(config)` would throw
"method too new" the first time a config file adds a new dispatch, e.g. a new
`AbstractBoundaryConditionConfig` subtype, rather than only new field values.

`run_simulation` runs inside `tee_output`, writing to `log_path`; every other step prints to the
terminal only. It is the one step long enough and loud enough to be worth a transcript — a stacktrace
through the coupled model scrolls its own error message away — the one whose output is not
reproducible by re-running it, and the only one whose setup is guaranteed to name a `results_root` to
put the transcript in.

Parsing, `--help` and config resolution stay outside the tee, so a usage error leaves no log file
behind — which also means the log path is only ever resolved from a config that loaded.
